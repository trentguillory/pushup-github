# Pushup

Simple github client that displays basic profile info and a list of repositories. 

## How to run

Clone the project and create a `Config.xcconfig` file in the `Pushup` directory. This is how the file should be formatted:

```swift
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID = mygithubclientid
GITHUB_APP_SECRET = mygithubappsecret
```
